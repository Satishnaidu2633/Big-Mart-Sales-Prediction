# 🛒 Big Mart Sales Prediction

This project predicts the sales of items in various Big Mart stores using machine learning regression techniques. The goal is to assist in inventory management and sales strategy optimization.

## 📌 Project Overview

Big Mart is a retail company with multiple outlets. Sales are influenced by product features, store characteristics, and location. This project builds a predictive model using historical sales data to forecast future sales for different products.

## 📁 Dataset Description

The dataset contains features related to products and outlets, including:

- `Item_Identifier`: Unique ID for each product
- `Item_Weight`: Weight of the product
- `Item_Fat_Content`: Low Fat / Regular
- `Item_Visibility`: Product visibility in the store
- `Item_Type`: Category of the product
- `Item_MRP`: Maximum Retail Price
- `Outlet_Identifier`: Unique ID for the store
- `Outlet_Establishment_Year`: Year the store was established
- `Outlet_Size`: Size of the store (Small/Medium/High)
- `Outlet_Location_Type`: Tier of the city (Tier 1/2/3)
- `Outlet_Type`: Grocery Store / Supermarket Type1/2/3
- `Item_Outlet_Sales`: Target variable (sales)

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- NumPy
- Matplotlib & Seaborn (Visualization)
- Scikit-learn (Model building)

## 📊 Workflow

1. Data Cleaning & Preprocessing
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
3. Feature Engineering
4. Model Training (XGBoost)
5. Model Evaluation (R² Score, RMSE)
6. Prediction on test data

## ✅ Model Performance

## 🚀 Future Improvements

- 🔧 **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Use `GridSearchCV` or `RandomizedSearchCV` to improve model performance.
- 🌲 **Ensemble Methods**: Implement models like `Random Forest`, `XGBoost`, or `LightGBM` for better accuracy.
- 🧠 **Feature Selection**: Apply techniques such as Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) to reduce overfitting and enhance model generalization.
- 🌐 **Model Deployment**: Build an interactive web application using `Streamlit` or `Flask` for real-time predictions.
- 📊 **Cross-Validation**: Use K-Fold Cross Validation to assess model robustness and stability.
- 📈 **Advanced Visualization**: Incorporate tools like `Plotly` or `Dash` for interactive data exploration.
- 🧹 **Pipeline Automation**: Create an end-to-end ML pipeline using `scikit-learn`’s `Pipeline` or `MLflow` for reproducibility.
